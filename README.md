Inspiration

The recent slew of natural disasters, such as California wildfires, Hawaii's volcanic eruptions, and Puerto Rico's hurricanes have made it clear that improvements in disaster relief and recovery are vital.

What it does

In order to remediate and improve the disaster relief and recovery process, we decided to design and build AidTech, a 3-tiered web application meant for internal users of disaster relief and recovery organizations, such as Red Cross. It allows the organizations to better manage their operations of allocating funds, tracking supplies and resources, and locating trapped or missing survivors.

How we built it

The web application was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The API's we used are Google Maps and Video Intelligence.
